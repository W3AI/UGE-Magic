# UGE Story

Remember when Elon Musk said that very likely we live in a simulation computer of an advanced civilization?

Let's suppose for a moment that he was right, if our reality is a simulation, the nature of our reality must adhere to the design choices of its architects.

One notable property of our reality is chaos, as defined by the laws of thermodynamics. 
Another notable property is the passage of time. 

Time is an interesting design pattern, as it allows for change within a system. Coupled with chaos, 
the overall effect we've observed is that anything that exists in our reality must be able to survive 
the chaos around it. 

Perhaps the best known example of such a surviving system is biological life. Through a process we've dubbed "evolution"
biological systems are "graded" based on their ability to survive. Over millennia, these biological systems have resulted
in the human race. 

Continuing on this train of thought, our evolution could be thought of as analogous to the infinite monkey
theorem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) . Only instead of producing Shakespeare's 
works, they happened to produce the human race.

But to complete the infinite monkey analogy, we'd have to identify what the monkey operated keyboards
were influencing in our reality, and how. 

To keep things simple let's suppose that the keyboards were hooked up to the computer running our reality 
and that they were editing files of a sort of Universal Game Engine or UGE for short. 

UGE files would have to describe components of systems that interact with each other in our reality.

For two components to successfully interact, the inputs of one component, must match with the outputs of another.

Since a key property of our reality is the chaos we've previously discussed, exactly which components end
up interacting together is left to chaos, or the entities which survive with in it. 

The concept of a UGE on a whole is interesting, but hard to imagine. To help our imaginations cope,
I've put together a little game that illustrates all of the above concepts. It's based on break out,
but see what happens when you stop playing it... 

[See the simple UGE example here](game.html)

I believe it would be interesting to explore the concept of UGEs on a grander scale, perhaps to handle
business, technological, and research applications. The design pattern seems to be radically more 
flexible than the systems we have today.

My progress to building proof of concepts for larger scope UGEs can be found here:

enough said - now back to coding those UGE DNA scripts ...
